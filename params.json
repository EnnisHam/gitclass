Use Cargo to build the project\r\n\r\n    cargo build --release\r\n\r\nThis will compile the project on your platform. You can then copy the result to a directory known to your `PATH`. For example:\r\n\r\n    sudo cp target/release/gitclass /usr/local/bin/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating a classroom\r\n\r\n    gitclass init name-of-class\r\n\r\nA new directory with your class name now exists. If `name-of-class` is omitted, a the current directory will be used as the container for the class. You will be prompted for some information about the class, like a name, description, and master repository for the teacher's code.\r\n\r\n### Adding students\r\n\r\n    gitclass add-student\r\n\r\nThis will prompt for `name` and `repo` for the student, then clone the given repo into a folder of the name provided.\r\n\r\n### Pulling Student Repos\r\nPerform this every time you want to ensure you have the latest commits from your students.\r\n\r\n    gitclass update\r\n\r\nThis will update all repos.\r\n\r\n**This feature is a little hacky as I figure out the `git2` library for Rust.**\r\n\r\n### Removing students\r\n\r\n    gitclass remove name",
